It is basically for all the tourist to come to visit India. Mumbai is located in the western part of India and is known as the Island City . It has many places to explore and is one of the important tourist destinations of the country. Hence, analysing the data of Mumbai using foursquare api will be highly helpful for new people who are migrating to Mumbai or comming to visit the city for a short span of time.
